## COMPLETE SCRIPT WITH TIMINGS

### SECTION 1: THE URGENT PROBLEM (0:00 - 0:35)
**PRESENTER:** Dr. Valerio Trigos  
**SHOT:** Medium, looking at camera  
**TONE:** Urgent but professional

---

**[0:00 - 0:12]**  
**DIRECTION:** Camera starts, Valerio looks directly, serious posture

> "My name is Valerio Trigos. I am a family physician in the Andalusian public health system. I manage six thousand five hundred patients.  
> 
> And every single day, I spend between thirty and forty-five minutes on tasks a machine could do in seconds."

**VISUAL:** Text overlay: "Dr. Valerio Trigos | SAS Physician | 6,500 patients"

---

**[0:12 - 0:22]**  
**DIRECTION:** Slight lean forward, more intensity

> "Renewing prescriptions. Copying lab results. Filling referral forms.  
> 
> While my patients wait."

**VISUAL:** Fade to waiting room image (stock) or keep on Valerio

---

**[0:22 - 0:35]**  
**DIRECTION:** Brief pause, let it land

> "Six thousand five hundred patients. That is my panel. And I simply do not have enough hours in the day to give them the care they deserve.  
> 
> This is a problem affecting 1.9 million doctors across Europe."

**VISUAL:** Graph: "1.9M EU physicians × 2 hours/day lost = 3.8M hours daily wasted"

---

### SECTION 2: THE SOLUTION (0:35 - 1:15)
**PRESENTER:** Dr. Valerio Trigos → transition to Sami Halawa  
**SHOT:** Split screen or direct cut  
**TONE:** Warmer, this is the pivot to hope

---

**[0:35 - 0:50]**  
**VALERIO (continues):**  
**DIRECTION:** Warmer tone, this is the turn

> "This is why we built UMBRAMED.  
> 
> It is an AI-powered clinical assistant that integrates directly with existing electronic health record systems like Diraya."

**VISUAL:** Cut to screen showing UMBRAMED logo + Diraya interface screenshot (anonymized)

---

**[0:50 - 1:05]**  
**SAMI (enters):**  
**SHOT:** Sami in office, with visible laptop  
**DIRECTION:** Count on fingers while listing

> "UMBRAMED reads patient context. Pre-fills prescriptions. Suggests referrals based on clinical guidelines. Drafts discharge summaries.  
> 
> Not replacing the doctor, but giving them back the forty percent of their day that paperwork steals."

**VISUAL:** Simple animation: "40% admin time → 10% with UMBRAMED" (bar chart)

---

**[1:05 - 1:15]**  
**SAMI (continues):**  
**DIRECTION:** Confidence, data-backed

> "We are not building something theoretical. UMBRAMED already processes clinical notes using large language models fine-tuned on European medical protocols.  
> 
> It understands SNOMED-CT codes, ICD-10 classifications, and the specific workflow of a primary care consultation."

**VISUAL:** Quick demo (10 sec): click on patient → UMBRAMED generates prescription draft → doctor reviews

---

### SECTION 3: REAL CLINICAL VALIDATION (1:15 - 1:50)
**PRESENTER:** Dr. Valerio Trigos (returns)  
**SHOT:** Valerio again, now with clear medical authority  
**TONE:** Institutional credibility

---

**[1:15 - 1:30]**  
**VALERIO:**  
**DIRECTION:** Show authority, medical credibility

> "What makes UMBRAMED different?  
> 
> I am not a consultant who visits a hospital once a year. I use the system every day. I know exactly where the bottlenecks are because I live inside them."

**VISUAL:** B-roll: Valerio in consultation (ethical, no recognizable patients) or Diraya screen

---

**[1:30 - 1:45]**  
**VALERIO (continues):**  
**DIRECTION:** Cut to real Diraya screenshot, anonymized

> "This is my actual working environment. Every physician in the Andalusian public health system uses this interface. Forty-four thousand doctors. Eight point five million patients.  
> 
> And I can tell you exactly where AI can save fifteen minutes per consultation."

**VISUAL:** Diraya screenshot (critical: must be real but FULLY anonymized)

---

**[1:45 - 1:50]**  
**VALERIO (continues):**  
**DIRECTION:** Impact pause

> "We already have a study protocol designed. Case-control design. With a cohort of six thousand five hundred patients for clinical validation."

**VISUAL:** Text: "Approved protocol | 6,500 patients | Real clinical validation"

---

### SECTION 4: EUROPEAN IMPACT (1:50 - 2:25)
**PRESENTER:** Sami Halawa  
**SHOT:** Sami, now with market graphs  
**TONE:** European vision, scalability

---

**[1:50 - 2:05]**  
**SAMI:**  
**DIRECTION:** Confidence, market data

> "This is not just a Spanish problem. It is European.  
> 
> One point nine million primary care physicians in the EU spend an average of forty percent of their time on administration. That is seven hundred sixty thousand full-time equivalent physicians lost to paperwork alone."

**VISUAL:** EU map with statistics: "1.9M physicians × 40% time = €47B/year wasted"

---

**[2:05 - 2:20]**  
**SAMI (continues):**  
**DIRECTION:** Focus on European regulation

> "With the EU AI Act now in force, we have a clear framework for medical AI. UMBRAMED is being designed from day one to comply with EU MDR as a Class IIa medical device.  
> 
> This means mandatory human oversight, algorithmic transparency, and continuous clinical audits."

**VISUAL:** Logos: "EU AI Act | MDR Compliant | Class IIa Medical Device"

---

**[2:20 - 2:25]**  
**SAMI (continues):**

> "Our two point five million euro request to the EIC Accelerator will take us from TRL five-six to TRL eight: multi-center validation, CE marking, and commercial launch."

**VISUAL:** Simple roadmap visual: "TRL 5-6 → Validation → CE Mark → TRL 8"

---

### SECTION 5: CALL TO ACTION (2:25 - 3:00)
**PRESENTERS:** Dr. Valerio Trigos + Sami Halawa (both)  
**SHOT:** Split or quick alternating sequence  
**TONE:** Urgency + confidence

---

**[2:25 - 2:40]**  
**VALERIO:**  
**DIRECTION:** Return to emotional urgency from opening

> "Every day that passes, I lose time I could dedicate to my patients.  
> 
> Patients with diabetes who need monitoring. Elderly with heart failure. Children with asthma.  
> 
> While I fill out forms."

**VISUAL:** Return to Valerio in consultation, serious expression

---

**[2:40 - 2:55]**  
**SAMI:**  
**DIRECTION:** Absolute confidence, strong close

> "UMBRAMED is not a promise. It is a functional tool built by a physician who understands the problem because he lives it.  
> 
> With EIC support, we can validate it at European scale, obtain regulatory approval, and give doctors back the time that belongs to them."

**VISUAL:** Final quick demo: complete renewal flow in 10 seconds

---

**[2:55 - 3:00]**  
**VALERIO + SAMI (alternating or split):**  
**DIRECTION:** Direct eye contact to camera, both

**VALERIO:**  
> "So they can do what really matters."

**SAMI:**  
> "Care for patients."

**VISUAL:** Fade to UMBRAMED logo + contact:  
**"UMBRAMED | Clinical AI for European Primary Care | umbramed.eu"**

**[END - 3:00]**

## DIRECTION NOTES FOR VALERIO

**Authenticity > Perfection**
- Don't memorize word for word → speak naturally
- Small pauses are fine → gives weight to words
- If you make a mistake → pause 2 seconds, repeat from start of sentence
- Direct eye contact with camera = contact with evaluators

**Body Language**
- First half (problem): serious, slightly tense
- Second half (solution): more relaxed, hopeful
- Minimal hand gestures (don't exaggerate)
- Upright but natural posture

**Voice Tone**
- 0:00-0:35: Urgent but not dramatic
- 0:35-1:15: Warmer, hopeful
- 1:15-1:50: Medical authority, confidence
- 2:25-3:00: Combination urgency + hope

---

## QUICK ALTERNATIVE (If no time for full production)

**MINIMALIST VERSION:**
- Valerio only, medical office, smartphone on tripod
- Decent audio (€30 lapel mic)
- No complex edits, just clean cuts
- Add 3-4 simple slides in post (basic PowerPoint)

**Production time:** 2-3 hours total (recording + basic editing)

**Free tools:**
- Editing: iMovie (Mac) / DaVinci Resolve (PC)
- Slides: Canva free or Google Slides

---

**CRITICAL REMINDER:**

This video is worth 50% of the weight in Step 1. Evaluators will see 500 videos from "techies" promising to revolutionize health.

Seeing a **REAL DOCTOR, in WHITE COAT, with REAL PATIENTS** is your absolute differentiation.

You don't need Hollywood. You need authenticity.
