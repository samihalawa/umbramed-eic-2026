## 🎬 FULL SCRIPT

### **SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM (0:00-0:30)**

**[VISUAL: Valerio in white coat, sitting at desk, looking directly at camera]**

**VALERIO:**  
> "Good morning. My name is Dr. Valerio Trigos. I am a family physician in the Andalusian public health system in Spain. I manage a panel of six thousand five hundred patients."

**[Brief pause - let the number land]**

> "And every single day, I waste between thirty and forty-five minutes on tasks a machine could do in seconds."

**[Slight lean forward - more intensity]**

> "Renewing prescriptions. Copying lab results into referral forms. Typing discharge summaries. While my patients wait in the corridor."

**[Show frustration, but controlled]**

> "Six thousand five hundred patients. That is my panel. And I simply do not have enough hours in the day to give them the care they deserve."

---

### **SECTION 2: THE SOLUTION (0:30-1:15)**

**[VISUAL: Tone shifts - warmer, solution-oriented]**

**VALERIO:**  
> "This is why we built UMBRAMED."

**[Turn slightly to gesture at laptop screen]**

> "It is an AI-powered clinical assistant that integrates directly with existing electronic health record systems like Diraya."

**[Count on fingers as listing]**

> "It reads the patient's clinical context. It pre-fills prescription renewals based on treatment history. It suggests referrals following clinical guidelines. It drafts discharge summaries using standardized medical language."

**[Look back at camera - emphasize]**

> "Not replacing me. But giving me back the forty percent of my day that paperwork steals."

**[VISUAL CUT TO: Screen capture of Diraya interface, anonymized - 5 seconds]**

**[VISUAL: Back to Valerio]**

**VALERIO:**  
> "We are not building something theoretical. UMBRAMED already processes clinical notes using large language models fine-tuned on European medical protocols. It understands SNOMED-CT codes, ICD-10 classifications, and the specific workflow of a primary care consultation."

---

### **SECTION 3: CLINICAL VALIDATION (1:15-2:00)**

**[VISUAL: Medical authority - this is the credibility moment]**

**VALERIO:**  
> "What makes UMBRAMED different from academic AI projects?"

**[Pause]**

> "I am not a consultant who visits a hospital once a year. I use this system every single day. I know exactly where the bottlenecks are because I live inside them."

**[VISUAL CUT TO: Screen showing Diraya interface with patient queue - anonymized - 5 seconds]**

**[VISUAL: Back to Valerio holding a medical chart]**

**VALERIO:**  
> "This is my actual working environment. Every physician in the Andalusian public health system uses this interface. Forty-four thousand doctors. Eight point five million patients."

**[Put down chart, look directly at camera]**

> "And I can tell you exactly where AI can save fifteen minutes per consultation without compromising safety."

**[VISUAL CUT TO: Split screen - manual workflow vs UMBRAMED workflow - 8 seconds]**
- **Left side:** Clock showing 5 minutes while typing manually
- **Right side:** Clock showing 45 seconds with UMBRAMED

**[VISUAL: Back to Valerio]**

**VALERIO:**  
> "We have already designed the clinical validation protocol. A case-control study across three primary care centers. Comparing time, accuracy, and patient outcomes between manual workflows and AI-assisted workflows. With full ethical approval from the Andalusian Health Service."

---

### **SECTION 4: THE IMPACT (2:00-2:30)**

**[VISUAL: Data-backed, confident tone]**

**VALERIO:**  
> "The impact is measurable and immediate."

**[VISUAL: Graphics appear on screen as he speaks]**

> "If we save just ten minutes per physician per day across the Spanish health system, that is forty-four thousand hours returned to patient care. Every single day."

**[Pause - let it sink in]**

> "That is one point six million additional patient consultations per year. Without hiring a single new doctor. Without building a single new clinic."

**[Gesture to emphasize]**

> "Just by removing the paperwork that prevents us from doing our jobs."

---

### **SECTION 5: THE ASK (2:30-3:00)**

**[VISUAL: Direct, clear, confident]**

**VALERIO:**  
> "We are not asking for funding to research whether this works. We are asking for funding to prove it at scale."

**[Count on fingers]**

> "In a real clinical environment. With real patients. Under real regulatory conditions."

**[Final look at camera - sincere]**

> "Because I believe European physicians deserve better tools. European patients deserve more time with their doctors. And European healthcare systems deserve solutions that work in the real world, not just in the laboratory."

**[Pause - 2 seconds]**

> "Thank you."

**[Hold on camera for 2 seconds before fade]**
